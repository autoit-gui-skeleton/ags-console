# Directory `./vendor`

This directory is the place where to conventionally store the code developed by third parties in a project. We create a folder by depedency, and where the code source is store. We also have a specific folder `./vendor/AGS-components` where all AGS components are store. There are a set of AutoIt libraries specifiably for AGS, that you can use free in our own applications.
